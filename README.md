# elements_in_rust
Algorithms and Concepts from Stepanov's "Elements of Programming" implemented in Rust. Starting with chapter 6 "Iterators", because I think this is the most complex to implement in terms of type mechanics. Curerntly all the algorithms for plain Iterators are implemented along with some simple tests.
